Hi, I'm Yael Tzruia! 

🚀 As a Full-Stack Developer with a passion for pushing boundaries, I thrive on embracing change and challenging myself to new heights. My journey into the world of technology was a transformative one.

🎓 I kickstarted my career transition by enrolling in a Full-Stack Development course at ITC, where I gained a solid foundation in cutting-edge technologies. Since then, I've been on a relentless pursuit of honing my skills and knowledge in this dynamic field.

💼 My professional journey has taken me through diverse experiences, from freelancing to internship and a full-time role. I had the privilege of serving as a Front-End Developer Intern at Sue-App, where I contributed to the development of a cutting-edge platform from scratch. Later, I assumed the role of a Full-Stack Developer at NRGene, where I took on the challenges of building a robust application and website.

🌍 My journey also spans continents. Originally from Sweden, I embarked on a life-changing adventure when I moved to Israel at the age of 18 to study religion for three years. Eventually, I made Israel my permanent home at 24, charting a new course for myself in the world of programming.

💡 It was during this transformative period that I discovered my passion for the programming world. I realized that the power to create, innovate, and solve complex challenges resonated deeply with me.

🔧 With a background in full-stack development, a love for coding, and an unwavering commitment to continuous learning, I'm excited to take on new opportunities and contribute my skills to innovative projects.
